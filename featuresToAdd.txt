Updated from 0.2.0 onwards, contact @frostbitepillars on Telegram

1) Implement regular expression checks for date and time
2) Add in-case SQL check to validate (whether that timeslot actually has vacancy), whether date is >= curr.date
3) Add current date handling, I skipped that as I wanted to see if the general idea works, since it does(?) now need
to handle time checks for current date.
